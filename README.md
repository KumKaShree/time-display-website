# ⌚ Modern Time Display

A sleek and modern time display application that turns watching time into an art form. Built with SvelteKit while learning the framework (and questioning my life choices about time management).

## ✨ Features That Make Time Less Boring

- 🎨 Multiple themes (because staring at one color gets old)
- ⏰ 12/24 hour format (for those who can't count past 12)
- 🎯 New Year countdown (for professional procrastinators)
- 📊 Year progress tracking (to remind you of your unfinished resolutions)
- 💫 Smooth animations (smoother than your coffee)
- 🌓 Beautiful UI with backdrop blur (because clear backgrounds are so 2020)
- 📱 Fully responsive design (works on your phone, tablet, and time machine)

## 🛠 Built With

- SvelteKit (because React was too mainstream)
- TypeScript (for when JavaScript isn't painful enough)
- GSAP for animations (making numbers dance since 2023)
- TailwindCSS (because writing CSS is overrated)
- Lucide Icons (the pretty ones)

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
# Clone this masterpiece
git clone https://github.com/KumKaShree/time-display-website.git

# Install dependencies (grab a coffee, you'll need it)
npm install

# Start the time machine
npm run dev

# Build for production (if you're brave enough)
npm run build
```

## 📝 Learning Notes

This project was built while learning SvelteKit, focusing on:
- State management (because global variables are evil)
- Component lifecycle (birth, growth, and graceful death)
- Animations and transitions (making things pretty)
- TypeScript integration (for extra headaches)
- Responsive design (because phones exist)

## 🤔 Why This Exists

Because regular clocks are boring, and we all need a more elegant way to watch our lives tick away. Plus, it was a great excuse to learn SvelteKit!
